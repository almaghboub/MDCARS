MD CARS – Car Accessories Sales & Inventory Management System
System Overview

MD CARS is a single-branch car accessories sales and inventory management system designed to manage daily retail operations in one store.
The system focuses on accurate stock control, fast sales processing, customer tracking, and clear financial records.
